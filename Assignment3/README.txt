A python program to analyze the trace of IP datagrams created by traceroute.
For this assignment, We investigated the IP protocol, focusing on the IP datagram. We did so by analyzing a trace of IP datagrams sent and received by an execution of the traceroute program. We investigated the various fields in the IP datagram, and study IP fragmentation in detail.

How to use programs:
Step 1: Unzip the file.
Step 2: execute e.g. python3 traffic.py group1-trace1.pcap
